Developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group, it was created to compress audio files without sacrificing much of the original quality. MP3 files significantly reduced file sizes while maintaining a reasonable level of sound fidelity, making it easy to store and share music online. The format's widespread adoption made it the de facto standard for digital audio, allowing music lovers to create vast digital music libraries and enjoy their favorite songs on various devices. "

By utilizing lossy compression, JPEG files can achieve significant reductions in file size while maintaining acceptable image quality. This format is widely used in photography and digital imaging, allowing photographers and users to store and share high-resolution images with relatively small file sizes. Although it sacrifices some fine details, JPEG's efficient compression has made it a go-to format for web graphics and digital photography. "

Unlike GIF, PNG supports full-color images with high color depth and provides lossless compression. This means that PNG files can preserve all the original details and colors of an image while still achieving compression. PNG is widely used for images with transparency, such as logos, icons, and graphics, as it allows for clean edges and smooth transitions between opaque and transparent areas. "

GIFs use a simple and efficient compression algorithm that allows for short and looping animations. While limited in color depth and resolution compared to other formats, GIFs became a beloved medium for sharing short and humorous animations on the internet. They are commonly used for expressing emotions, reactions, and conveying visual messages in a concise and engaging manner. "

Photoshop has a huge amount of features for photographers to slightly enhance existing images by e.g. improving lighting or adjusting the colour. The features don't end there though, people all over the world use it to adjust pictures completely and e.g. make it seem a car is flying. \n" +
                    "**Premier Pro/Rush**. Whist _Premier Pro_ is the current Adobe-flagship of video editing all across YouTube and Hollywood, _Premier Rush_ is very popular among people who prefer to edit their videos on mobile devices. \n" +
                    "**After Effects** basically is the industry standard for VFX and CGI. VFX is the act of adding artifical computer-generated art/3-D graphics to _already existing_ videos, whilst CGI on the other hand is the creation of videos which purely consist of computer-generated 3-D graphics.\n" +
                    "**Davinci Resolve** is the way to go if one wants a whole arsenal of tools to create their own blockbuster movie: It has a built-in *\"speed-editor\"*, to quickly skip through a timeline and cut individual clips, a *\"normal editor\"*, in which the majority of the cutting and editing happens with basic transitions and titles, *\"fusion\"* - basically Adobe Aftereffects - where it's possible to create complex VFX and simple transitions and an entire \"*colour-grading section*\", which is pretty selfexplanatory.  \n" +
