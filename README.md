# SueyWiky

This is a project showcasing the abilities of _Romanian Gangsta_ and
_Fight and Attack Aircraft-18 Super Hornet currently intercepting enemy bombers in an act of reconnaissance in order to defend my former legion_
in creating a fully-functional and good-looking `React` Wikipedia-like website doing exactly one thing: Being a wiki.

## How to run

Clone the project to your machine:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Rad14nt/SueyWiky.git
```

Locate the project root and run the application:

```bash
> npm run start
```

Access the website via [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

That's it, you just deployed our wiki!
